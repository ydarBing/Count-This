## Count This: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Count This app for Android!

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences (like theme, etc.), counters and locations) created by the you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

The list of permissions required by the app can be found in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

<br/>

| Permission | Why it is required |
| :---: | --- |
| `android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` | User or device physical location to an area greater than or equal to 3 square kilometers, such as the city a user is in.  This is only required for counters that track location.  You, as the user, or the system, can revoke this permission at any time from Settings. Revoking this permission will stop locations from being collected and saved when a counter is incremented. |
| `android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` | User or device physical location within an area less than 3 square kilometers.  This is only required for counters that track location.  You, as the user, or the system, can revoke this permission at any time from Settings. Revoking this permission will stop locations from being collected and saved when a counter is incremented. |

Thank you,
